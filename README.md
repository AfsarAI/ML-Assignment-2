# 🧠 MLP Assignment 2
**Machine Learning Practice – IIT Madras BS Degree Program**

---

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains my **Assignment 2** for the *Machine Learning Practice (MLP)* course, part of the **IIT Madras BS Degree** program.
This assignment focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, where I perform a comprehensive analysis of the dataset. The primary goal is to understand the data's structure, identify anomalies, and derive initial insights through statistical analysis and visualization.

## 🧩 Tools and Libraries Used

-   **Python 3**
-   **Pandas** for data manipulation
-   **NumPy** for numerical operations
-   **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for data visualization
-   **Jupyter/Kaggle Notebooks** as the development environment

## ⚙️ Key Steps

-   **Loaded** the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
-   Performed a detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the data's characteristics.
-   **Identified and imputed missing values** to ensure data completeness.
-   Checked for and handled any **duplicate records**.
-   Analyzed the presence of **outliers** and decided on a handling strategy.
-   Created multiple **visualizations** (like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots) to uncover patterns and relationships.
-   Summarized key **observations** from the analysis.

## 🏁 Results
The analysis provided a solid understanding of the dataset's underlying structure, distributions, and potential issues. Key insights were derived from visualizations, and the data was cleaned and prepared for potential future modeling tasks.
